# Substance

Substance is a web-based technology stack for collaborative document manipulation. Substance releases all building blocks as Open Source under an MIT license, so you can glue them together for your usecase.

# Getting started

We've prepared a sandbox where you can play around with our editor and run the tests. It's meant to be a starting point for creating your very-own Substance application.

Installation is easy:

1. Install the [Substance Screwdriver](http://github.com/substance/screwdriver) command line utility.

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/substance/screwdriver.git
   $ cd screwdriver
   $ sudo python setup.py install
   ```

2. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/substance/substance.git
   ```
   
2. Run the update command, which pulls in all required dependencies

   ```bash
   $ cd substance
   $ substance --update
   ```
   
3. Finally start the server and point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

   ```bash
   $ substance
   ```
