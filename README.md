Substance
===================

Substance provides an extensive, customizable content creation and annotation framework that enables user-centric interfaces and automatic data processing via your web-browser or Node.js. Thanks to its modular nature it creates an ideal environment for custom integration scenarios.

In this repository you find all official Substance releases. We will turn this into a developer's sandbox over the coming months.
