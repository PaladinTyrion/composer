Scientific Markdown Example
===========================

This is an example for a Markdown file that uses the extended
Markdown features as supported by `Pandoc 1.12`.
We will use this as a more convenient substitute for `NLM` input files.

For example it is possible to use inline math as known from latex.
E.g, you could say that a quadratic $x^2$ is a polynomial function of $x$.

An equation looks like this:

$$
f(x) = x^2 + 5
$$


There is experimental support for tables:

Column 1     Column 2     Column 3      Column 4
--------     --------    ----------    ---------
       1     2                3               4
       5     6                7               8
       9     10              11              12

Table:  Using simple table syntax.
